           Installation instructions for Algorithm::SVMLight

In order to install this module, you must first install the core
SVMLight software, including the modifications in the SVMLight.patch
file (included with the Algorithm::SVMLight distribution):

   # From the directory with SVMLight's sources:
   patch -p0 < SVMLight.patch
   make

This will provide a "libsvmlight.a" library (or whatever the
equivalent filename is on your system) against which the perl module
will be linked.

After installing the core SVMLight software, follow the standard
procedure for installing Module::Build-based perl modules:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install  (may need to be done as root)

If the headers and/or library aren't in a location where your compiler
will find them by itself, in the first step you can tell it where they
are like so:

  perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags "-I/foo/include -Wall" \
                --extra_linker_flags   "-L/foo/lib -lsvmlight"
