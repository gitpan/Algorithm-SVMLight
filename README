    Algorithm::SVMLight Perl module
    =================================

This module provides a Perl interface to the SVMLight code for Support
Vector Machines written by Thorsten Johachims.  It may be downloaded
from http://kodiak.cs.cornell.edu/svm_light/v6.01/svm_light.tar.gz .

Please see the documentation of Algorithm::SVMLight for details on how
to use the perl interface.


DOWNLOADING

The two ingredients you must obtain are the core SVMLight code, and
the Perl interface:

   http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/v6.02/svm_light.tar.gz
   http://cpan.org/authors/id/K/KW/KWILLIAMS/Algorithm-SVMLight-0.08.tar.gz

UNPACKING

Put the SVMLight.patch file from Algorithm-SVMLight in the top-level
directory of the core SVMLight code (note that svm_light.tar.gz is a
"tar bomb"):

   tar -zxvf Algorithm-SVMLight-0.08.tar.gz
   mkdir svm_light
   mv svm_light.tar.gz svm_light
   cd svm_light
   tar -zxvf svm_light.tar.gz
   cp ../Algorithm-SVMLight-0.08/SVMLight.patch .

INSTALLATION

Apply the SVMLight.patch file, then build svmlight:

   patch -p1 < SVMLight.patch
   make

This will provide "libsvmlight.a" and "libsvmlight.so" libraries (or
whatever the equivalent filenames are on your system), and one of them
should be able to be used for linking with the perl module.

The Perl wrapper can then be installed as follows:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install  (may need to be done as root)

If the SVMLight headers/library aren't in a location where your
compiler/linker will find them by itself, in the first step you can
tell it where they are like so:

  perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags "-I/foo/include -Wall" \
                --extra_linker_flags   "-L/foo/lib -lsvmlight"

DEPENDENCIES

As described above, this module requires a patched version of
SVMLight.  Installation requires Module::Build version 0.21 and
Test::More (any version), but they are not used after installation.
