    Algorithm::SVMLight Perl module
    =================================

This module provides a Perl interface to the SVMLight code for Support
Vector Machines written by Thorsten Johachims.  It may be downloaded
from http://kodiak.cs.cornell.edu/svm_light/v6.01/svm_light.tar.gz .

Please see the documentation of Algorithm::SVMLight for details on how
to use the perl interface.


INSTALLATION

In order to install this module, you must first install the core SVMLight
code, including the modifications in the SVMLight.patch file (included
with the Algorithm-SVMLight distribution):

   # From the directory with SVMLight's sources:
   patch -p0 < SVMLight.patch
   make

This will provide a "libsvmlight.a" library (or whatever the
equivalent filename is on your system) against which the perl module
will be linked.

After installing SVMLight,  the Perl wrapper can be
installed as follows:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install  (may need to be done as root)

If the SVMLight headers/library aren't in a location where your
compiler/linker will find them by itself, in the first step you can
tell it where they are like so:

  perl Build.PL --extra_compiler_flags "-I/foo/include -Wall" \
                --extra_linker_flags   "-L/foo/lib -lsvmlight"

DEPENDENCIES

As described above, this module requires a patched version of
SVMLight.  Installation requires Module::Build version 0.21 and
Test::More (any version), but they are not used after installation.
